# Getting Started with Python: Basics and Syntax

## Introduction

In this session, we will explore the fundamentals of Python programming. Python is a versatile language known for its simplicity and readability, making it a great choice for beginners. This document will cover essential concepts including variables, data types, control structures, functions, basic input/output, error handling, and more advanced topics such as file handling, libraries, and object-oriented programming.

## 1. Variables and Data Types

### Variables

- Variables are used to store information that can be referenced and manipulated in a program.
- You can declare a variable and assign it a value using the assignment operator (`=`).

```python
# Example
name = "Hasan"
age = 20
is_student = True
```

### Data Types

Python supports several data types:

- **Integers**: Whole numbers (e.g., `42`, `-5`).
- **Floats**: Decimal numbers (e.g., `3.14`, `-0.001`).
- **Strings**: Text wrapped in quotes (e.g., `"Hello, World!"`).
- **Lists**: Ordered collections of items (e.g., `[1, 2, 3, 4]`).
- **Tuples**: Similar to lists, but immutable (e.g., `(1, 2, 3)`).
- **Dictionaries**: Key-value pairs (e.g., `{"name": "Hasan", "age": 20}`).

```python
# Example
age = 20               # Integer
height = 5.9          # Float
greeting = "Hello!"    # String
scores = [90, 85, 88]  # List
profile = {"name": "Hasan", "age": 20}  # Dictionary
```

## 2. Control Structures

### Conditional Statements

Control the flow of your program using conditional statements. This allows you to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions.

```python
# Example
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
elif age >= 13:
    print("You are a teenager.")
else:
    print("You are a child.")
```

### Loops

Loops allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times.

- **For Loop**: Iterates over a sequence (e.g., list, string).

```python
# Example
for i in range(5):
    print(i)  # Prints numbers 0 to 4
```

- **While Loop**: Continues until a specified condition is false.

```python
# Example
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1  # Increments count by 1
```

## 3. Functions

Functions are reusable pieces of code that perform a specific task. You can define a function using the `def` keyword.

### Defining and Calling Functions

```python
# Example
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("Hasan"))  # Output: Hello, Hasan!
```

### Parameters and Return Values

Functions can accept parameters and return values, allowing for flexible and reusable code.

```python
# Example
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add_numbers(5, 3)  # result will be 8
print(result)
```

## 4. Basic Input/Output

### Input

You can take user input using the `input()` function. The input is always returned as a string.

```python
# Example
user_name = input("Enter your name: ")
print(f"Welcome, {user_name}!")
```

### Output

You can display output using the `print()` function. It can take multiple arguments and format them.

```python
# Example
age = 20
print("My name is", name, "and I am", age, "years old.")
```

## 5. Error Handling

Understanding how to handle errors is crucial for writing robust programs. You can use `try` and `except` to catch exceptions.

```python
# Example
try:
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    print("You entered:", num)
except ValueError:
    print("That's not a valid number!")
```

## 6. File Handling

Learn how to read from and write to files in Python.

### Writing to a File

You can create and write to a file using the `open()` function.

```python
# Example
with open("example.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, World!")
```

### Reading from a File

You can read from a file in different modes.

```python
# Example
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)  # Output: Hello, World!
```

## 7. Working with Libraries

Python has a rich ecosystem of libraries that can be easily imported into your projects.

### Using Built-in Libraries

You can use libraries like `math` and `random`.

```python
import math
import random

# Example of using math library
print(math.sqrt(16))  # Output: 4.0

# Example of using random library
print(random.randint(1, 10))  # Output: Random number between 1 and 10
```

### Installing Third-Party Libraries

Use `pip` to install additional libraries. For example, to install the `requests` library:

```bash
pip install requests
```

## 8. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

OOP is a programming paradigm that uses "objects" to design applications. Python supports OOP principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

### Defining a Class

```python
# Example
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def bark(self):
        return f"{self.name} says Woof!"

# Creating an object
my_dog = Dog("Buddy", 3)
print(my_dog.bark())  # Output: Buddy says Woof!
```

### Inheritance

Inheritance allows one class to inherit attributes and methods from another.

```python
# Example
class Puppy(Dog):
    def play(self):
        return f"{self.name} is playing!"

my_puppy = Puppy("Charlie", 1)
print(my_puppy.play())  # Output: Charlie is playing!
```

## Conclusion

This session covered the basic syntax and structure of Python, including variables, data types, control structures, functions, input/output, error handling, file handling, libraries, and object-oriented programming. Mastering these concepts is essential for writing effective Python programs.

## Exercises

1. **Variables**: Create a variable to store your favorite color and print it.

   ```python
   favorite_color = "blue"
   print("My favorite color is", favorite_color)
   ```

2. **Conditionals**: Write a program that checks if a number is even or odd.

   ```python
   number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
   if number % 2 == 0:
       print("The number is even.")
   else:
       print("The number is odd.")
   ```

3. **Loops**: Use a loop to print the numbers from 1 to 10.

   ```python
   for i in range(1, 11):
       print(i)
   ```

4. **Functions**: Write a function that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their product.

   ```python
   def multiply(a, b):
       return a * b

   result = multiply(4, 5)
   print("The product is:", result)
   ```

5. **Error Handling**: Modify the previous number input example to handle invalid inputs gracefully.

6. **File Handling**: Create a program that writes user input to a file and then reads from that file to display the content.

7. **Library Usage**: Write a program that generates a random password of a specified length using the `random` library.

8. **OOP**: Create a simple class representing a `Car`, with attributes like `make`, `model`, and `year`, and a method to display the carâ€™s details.
