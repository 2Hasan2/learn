# Day 4: Advanced Python Concepts and Applications

## Introduction
Today, we will explore more advanced Python topics, including modules and packages, decorators, context managers, working with APIs, testing, best practices, as well as more complex data structures, exception handling, asynchronous programming, and an introduction to Python's standard library.

## 1. Modules and Packages

### Understanding Modules
- A module is a Python file containing definitions and statements. It allows you to logically organize your code into manageable sections.
- You can import modules using the `import` statement.

```python
# Example of importing a module
import math

print(math.pi)  # Output: 3.141592653589793
```

### Creating Your Own Module
- You can create your own module by saving functions in a `.py` file and then importing it.

```python
# my_module.py
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

# main.py
import my_module

print(my_module.greet("Hasan"))  # Output: Hello, Hasan!
```

### Packages
- A package is a collection of modules organized in directories. Use the `__init__.py` file to mark a directory as a package.

```plaintext
my_package/
    __init__.py
    module1.py
    module2.py
```

### Importing Specific Functions
- You can import specific functions from a module to avoid using the module name each time.

```python
from math import sqrt

print(sqrt(16))  # Output: 4.0
```

## 2. Decorators
- Decorators are a powerful tool in Python that allow you to modify the behavior of a function or method.
- They are defined using the `@decorator_name` syntax.

### Creating a Simple Decorator
```python
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        func()
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

say_hello()
```

### Using Built-in Decorators
Python has several built-in decorators, such as `@staticmethod`, `@classmethod`, and `@property`.

```python
class MyClass:
    @staticmethod
    def static_method():
        print("This is a static method.")

MyClass.static_method()  # Output: This is a static method.
```

### Parameterized Decorators
You can create decorators that accept arguments.

```python
def repeat(num_times):
    def decorator_repeat(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            for _ in range(num_times):
                func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return decorator_repeat

@repeat(3)
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("Hasan")
```

## 3. Context Managers
- Context managers allow you to allocate and release resources precisely when you want. The most common way to use them is with the `with` statement.

### Creating a Context Manager
```python
class MyContextManager:
    def __enter__(self):
        print("Entering the context.")
        return self

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        print("Exiting the context.")

with MyContextManager() as manager:
    print("Inside the context.")
```

### Using the `with` Statement for File Handling
The `with` statement is often used for file handling to ensure that files are properly closed after their suite finishes.

```python
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
```

### Built-in Context Managers
Python has built-in context managers, such as `open()` for files and `threading.Lock()` for thread synchronization.

```python
from contextlib import closing
from urllib.request import urlopen

with closing(urlopen("http://www.python.org")) as page:
    for line in page:
        print(line)
```

## 4. Working with APIs
- APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) allow you to interact with web services. The `requests` library is commonly used for making HTTP requests.

### Making a GET Request
```python
import requests

response = requests.get("https://api.github.com")
print(response.status_code)  # Output: 200
print(response.json())  # Output: JSON response from the API
```

### Making a POST Request
You can also send data to an API using a POST request.

```python
data = {"name": "Hasan", "age": 20}
response = requests.post("https://api.example.com/user", json=data)
print(response.json())  # Output: Response from the API
```

### Handling API Responses
Always check the status code and handle exceptions when dealing with APIs.

```python
try:
    response = requests.get("https://api.github.com/user")
    response.raise_for_status()  # Raises an HTTPError for bad responses
    user_data = response.json()
except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as err:
    print(f"HTTP error occurred: {err}")
except Exception as err:
    print(f"An error occurred: {err}")
```

## 5. Testing in Python
Testing is crucial for ensuring your code works as expected. Python provides a built-in module called `unittest` for writing and running tests.

### Writing a Simple Test Case
```python
import unittest

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

class TestMathMethods(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_add(self):
        self.assertEqual(add(1, 2), 3)
    
    def test_add_negative(self):
        self.assertEqual(add(-1, 1), 0)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

### Running Tests
You can run your tests by executing the script in the terminal or using test discovery with the `unittest` module.

```bash
python -m unittest discover
```

## 6. Best Practices
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines for Python code style and formatting.
- Write clear and concise docstrings for functions and classes.
- Use version control (e.g., Git) to manage your code changes.
- Write unit tests to ensure code reliability.
- Modularize your code for better maintainability.
- Keep functions short and focused on a single task.

## 7. Exception Handling
- Exception handling allows you to manage errors gracefully without crashing your program.

### Using try, except, and finally
```python
try:
    x = 1 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("You cannot divide by zero.")
finally:
    print("This will execute no matter what.")
```

### Raising Exceptions
You can raise exceptions manually using the `raise` statement.

```python
def check_positive(number):
    if number < 0:
        raise ValueError("Number must be positive.")
    return number

try:
    check_positive(-5)
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)  # Output: Number must be positive.
```

## 8. Advanced Data Structures
- Python provides several built-in data structures, such as lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.

### Using Collections
The `collections` module provides specialized container datatypes.

#### NamedTuple
```python
from collections import namedtuple

Point = namedtuple('Point', ['x', 'y'])
p = Point(10, 20)
print(p.x, p.y)  # Output: 10 20
```

#### DefaultDict
```python
from collections import defaultdict

dd = defaultdict(int)
dd['key'] += 1
print(dd['key'])  # Output: 1
```

#### Counter
```python
from collections import Counter

count = Counter('hello world')
print(count)  # Output: Counter({'l': 3, 'o': 2, 'h': 1, 'e': 1, ' ': 1, 'w': 1, 'r': 1, 'd': 1})
```

## 9. Asynchronous Programming
- Python supports asynchronous programming through the `asyncio` module, allowing you to write concurrent code using the `async` and `await` keywords.

### Basic Example of Async Functions
```python
import asyncio

async def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print("Goodbye!")

async def main():
    await say_hello()

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Running Multiple Async Tasks
You can run multiple async tasks concurrently.

```python
async def task(name, delay):
    print(f"Task {name} starting")
    await asyncio.sleep(delay)
    print(f"Task {name} completed")

async def main():
    await asyncio.gather(task("A", 2), task("B", 1), task("C", 3))

asyncio.run(main())
```

## 10. Introduction to Python's Standard Library
Python comes with a rich standard library that provides modules and functions for various tasks.

### Useful Standard Library Modules
- `os`: Interact with the operating system.
- `sys`: Access command-line arguments and system-specific parameters.
- `json`: Work with JSON data.
- `random`: Generate random numbers and select random elements.
- `datetime`: Work with dates and times.

### Example of Using the `json` Module
```python
import json

# Convert Python object to JSON
data = {"name": "Hasan", "age": 20}
json_data = json.dumps(data)


print(json_data)  # Output: {"name": "Hasan", "age": 20}

# Convert JSON back to Python object
data_loaded = json.loads(json_data)
print(data_loaded)  # Output: {'name': 'Hasan', 'age': 20}
```
