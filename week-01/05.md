### **5. Working with GitHub Branches**

_Objective_: Learn how to utilize branches effectively in a collaborative environment using GitHub.

#### **Concepts to Cover**:

1. **Understanding Branches on GitHub**:

   - Branches are versions of a repository that allow for independent work on features or fixes without affecting the main codebase.
   - Common practices include using the `main` branch for production-ready code and feature branches for new developments.

2. **Creating and Managing Branches on GitHub**:

   - How to create a new branch on GitHub:
     - Navigate to the repository on GitHub.
     - Click the “Branch: main” dropdown, enter a new branch name, and click “Create branch”.
   - Managing branches via the GitHub web interface:
     - View branches, merge branches, delete branches.

3. **Pull Requests (PRs)**:

   - Explanation of PRs: A way to propose changes to a repository.
   - Steps to create a PR:
     1. Push the feature branch to GitHub:
        ```bash
        git push origin new-feature
        ```
     2. Navigate to the repository on GitHub.
     3. Click on "Pull requests" and then "New pull request".
     4. Select the base (main) and compare (new-feature) branches.
     5. Review changes and click “Create pull request”.

4. **Code Reviews**:
   - Importance of code reviews in collaborative development.
   - Use GitHub’s PR comments for feedback and discussions.
   - Merging a PR after review and approval.

### **6. Remote Repositories and SSH Connection**

_Objective_: Learn how to work with remote repositories securely using SSH.

#### **Concepts to Cover**:

1. **Adding Remote Repositories**:

   - Add a remote repository:
     ```bash
     git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository.git
     ```

2. **Connecting to GitHub via SSH**:

   - **Why Use SSH?**:

     - SSH (Secure Shell) provides a secure way to access remote Git repositories.
     - It eliminates the need to enter your username and password every time you push or pull changes.

   - **Generating an SSH Key**:

     1. Check for existing SSH keys:
        ```bash
        ls -al ~/.ssh
        ```
     2. Generate a new SSH key:
        ```bash
        ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your.email@example.com"
        ```
        - Follow the prompts to save the key and enter a passphrase for added security.

   - **Adding SSH Key to the SSH Agent**:

     ```bash
     eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"  # Start the ssh-agent in the background
     ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa    # Add your SSH private key
     ```

   - **Adding SSH Key to GitHub**:

     1. Copy the SSH public key to your clipboard:
        ```bash
        cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | pbcopy  # For macOS
        ```
        - Use `xclip` or `clip` for Linux/Windows.
     2. Go to your GitHub account settings:
        - Navigate to **SSH and GPG keys**.
        - Click **New SSH key** and paste the copied key into the key field.
        - Give it a title and save.

   - **Using SSH for Git Operations**:
     - Update your repository URL to use SSH:
       ```bash
       git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repository.git
       ```
     - Now, you can clone, push, and pull from your repository without entering your username and password:
       ```bash
       git clone git@github.com:username/repository.git
       ```

### **7. Viewing History and Undoing Changes**

_Objective_: Learn how to view commit history and manage changes effectively.

#### **Commands to Cover**:

1. **Viewing Commit History**:

   - Show commit history:
     ```bash
     git log
     ```
   - Use `git log --oneline` for a concise view.

2. **Viewing Changes**:

   - Show changes made in the working directory:
     ```bash
     git diff
     ```

3. **Undoing Changes**:
   - Undo uncommitted changes:
     ```bash
     git checkout -- filename.txt
     ```
   - Revert a committed change:
     ```bash
     git revert <commit_hash>
     ```
