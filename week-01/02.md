## **Day 2: Deep Dive into Bash, Shell Scripting, and Terminal Mastery**

### **1. Mastering File and Directory Management**

- **Objective**: Get students more comfortable with manipulating files and directories using the terminal.
- **Commands to Cover**:
  - **File Commands**: `touch`, `rm`, `cp`, `mv`, `cat`, `nano`.
  - **Directory Commands**: `mkdir`, `rmdir`, `ls`, `cd`, `pwd`, `tree`.
  - **Wildcards**: `*`, `?` for searching and pattern matching.
  - **File Permissions**: `chmod`, `chown`, `chgrp`. read ["Wildcards and Permissions"](./docs//Wildcards%20and%20Permissions.md)

**Learning Task**:

- Create, rename, delete files and directories.
- Use wildcards to perform batch operations (e.g., delete all `.txt` files at once).
- Set different permissions for files using `chmod`.

**Example Task**:

- Create a directory called `projects`, add three `.txt` files inside, rename them, and change their permissions to make one executable.

---

### **2. Hidden Files and File Permissions**

- **Objective**: Teach students about hidden files and how to manipulate file permissions.
- **Commands to Cover**:
  - **Hidden Files**: `ls -a` to show files like `.bashrc`, `.gitignore`.
  - **File Permissions**: `ls -l` to view, `chmod` to modify permissions.
  - **File Ownership**: `chown`, `chgrp` to change ownership.

**Learning Task**:

- View, edit, and understand the significance of `.bashrc` and `.profile`.
- Modify permissions using `chmod` to control who can read, write, and execute files.

**Example Task**:

- Add an alias in `.bashrc` to create a shortcut for listing files (`alias ll="ls -l"`).
- Make a text file executable and run it.

---

### **3. Pipes and Redirection**

- **Objective**: Teach students how to use pipes and redirect output effectively.
- **Commands to Cover**:
  - **Pipes (`|`)**: Combine multiple commands.
  - **Redirection (`>` and `>>`)**: Send output to files or append.
  - **Command chaining**: Use of `&&` and `||` to run multiple commands conditionally.
  - **Viewing Files**: `cat`, `less`, `more`, `tail`, `head`, `grep`.

**Learning Task**:

- Use pipes to combine commands like `ls` with `grep` to filter outputs.
- Redirect the output of a command to a file, then append new content to that file.
- Search through file contents using `grep`.

**Example Task**:

- List all files containing "project" in the name and redirect this list to `projects.txt`.
- Append a timestamp to `projects.txt` using the `date` command.

---

### **4. Shell Scripting Basics**

- **Objective**: Introduce students to writing and running basic shell scripts.
- **Concepts to Cover**:
  - **Creating a Script**: Use `#!/bin/bash` as the shebang.
  - **Variables**: Define and use variables within a script.
  - **Input and Output**: Use `read` to capture input, `echo` to display output.
  - **Conditional Statements**: `if`, `else` basics.
  - **Loops**: Simple `for` and `while` loops.
  - [Bash Script on Linux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2733cRPudvI&list=PLT98CRl2KxKGj-VKtApD8-zCqSaN2mD4w&index=1).

**Learning Task**:

- Write a script that asks for user input, performs an action, and displays the result.
- Implement basic conditional logic to respond to different inputs.

**Example Script**:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter a number:"
read number
if [ $number -gt 10 ]; then
  echo "The number is greater than 10."
else
  echo "The number is less than or equal to 10."
fi
```

**Example Task**:

- Write a script that takes two numbers from the user and adds them together.
- Write a loop that prints the numbers 1 to 10.

### **5. Give me more: Shell Scripting: Intermediate Concepts**

- **Objective**: Introduce students to writing and running basic shell scripts, enabling them to automate tasks and perform operations on the command line.

#### **Concepts to Cover**:

1. **Creating a Script**:

   - Use `#!/bin/bash` as the shebang to specify the script interpreter.
   - Make the script executable with `chmod +x scriptname.sh`.

2. **Variables**:

   - Define variables using the syntax `variable_name=value`.
   - Access variable values using `$variable_name`.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     name="Hasan"
     echo "Hello, $name!"
     ```

3. **Input and Output**:

   - Use `read` to capture input from the user.
   - Use `echo` to display output.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     echo "What's your name?"
     read user_name
     echo "Welcome, $user_name!"
     ```

4. **Conditional Statements**:

   - Use `if`, `elif`, and `else` for decision-making.
   - Use `[ condition ]` for test expressions.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     if [ "$user_name" == "Hasan" ]; then
       echo "Hello, Hasan!"
     else
       echo "Who are you?"
     fi
     ```

5. **Loops**:

   - Simple `for` loop to iterate over a list of items.
   - Simple `while` loop to repeat until a condition is met.
   - Example:

     ```bash
     for i in {1..5}; do
       echo "Iteration $i"
     done

     counter=1
     while [ $counter -le 5 ]; do
       echo "Counter: $counter"
       ((counter++))
     done
     ```

6. **Functions**:

   - Define reusable blocks of code using functions.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     function greet {
       echo "Hello, $1!"
     }
     greet "Hasan"
     ```

7. **Error Handling**:

   - Use `exit` to terminate a script with a status code.
   - Check the exit status of commands using `$?`.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     cp file.txt backup.txt
     if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
       echo "Failed to copy the file."
     fi
     ```

8. **Comments**:

   - Use `#` to add comments for better readability and documentation.

9. **make out tree command**

- it's simple ... do you remember `tree`, we will make it.
- [our tree](./docs/tree.md).

#### **Learning Task**:

- Write a script that asks for user input, performs an action, and displays the result.
- Implement basic conditional logic to respond to different inputs.
- Create functions for reusable code and practice error handling.

#### **Example Script**:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# This script determines if a number is even or odd
echo "Enter a number:"
read number

if [ $((number % 2)) -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "The number $number is even."
else
  echo "The number $number is odd."
fi
```

#### **Example Task**:

1. **Addition Script**:

   - Write a script that takes two numbers from the user and adds them together.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     echo "Enter first number:"
     read num1
     echo "Enter second number:"
     read num2
     sum=$((num1 + num2))
     echo "The sum of $num1 and $num2 is $sum."
     ```

2. **Loop to Print Numbers**:

   - Write a loop that prints the numbers 1 to 10.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     for i in {1..10}; do
       echo "Number: $i"
     done
     ```

3. **Interactive Menu**:

   - Create a script with an interactive menu that allows the user to choose an option (e.g., add, subtract, multiply, exit).
   - Example:

     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     while true; do
       echo "Choose an option:"
       echo "1. Add"
       echo "2. Subtract"
       echo "3. Exit"
       read choice

       case $choice in
         1)
           echo "Enter two numbers:"
           read num1 num2
           echo "Sum: $((num1 + num2))"
           ;;
         2)
           echo "Enter two numbers:"
           read num1 num2
           echo "Difference: $((num1 - num2))"
           ;;
         3)
           echo "Exiting..."
           break
           ;;
         *)
           echo "Invalid option, please try again."
           ;;
       esac
     done
     ```

### **6. Automating Tasks with Cron Jobs**

- **Objective**: Show students how to schedule scripts to run automatically using `cron`.
- **Concepts to Cover**:
  - **Setting up Cron Jobs**: Using `crontab -e` to edit cron jobs.
  - **Cron Syntax**: Explain the time fields (`* * * * *` format).
  - **Practical Use Cases**: Scheduling backup scripts, periodic tasks.

**Learning Task**:

- Schedule a script to run every minute that logs system uptime to a file.

**Example Task**:

- Write a script that logs the current date and time to a file called `log.txt` every minute.

**Example Cron Job**:

```bash
* * * * * /path/to/script.sh
```

### **7. Task for Day 2: Terminal & Shell Script Mastery**

- **Goal**: By the end of Day 2, students should be able to navigate directories, manipulate files, redirect output, and write simple to intermediate shell scripts.

**Final Task**:

1. Create a directory called `bash_practice` and practice file manipulation (`touch`, `cp`, `rm`, `mv`).
2. Write a script that asks the user for their age, compares it to 18, and outputs whether they are a minor or an adult.
3. Use pipes to list files and redirect their names to `files.txt`. Append the current time to `files.txt`.
4. Write a script that accepts a filename as input and tells the user if the file exists or not.
5. Set up a cron job that runs a shell script to back up a folder every day at 6 PM.

---

**Next Steps for Day 3** could include:

- **Process Management**: Understanding how to monitor and kill processes.
- **Networking Basics**: Learn about `ping`, `netstat`, `curl`, etc.
- **More Advanced Shell Scripting**: Arrays, advanced loops, and file handling.

......
Let's start with an introduction to **what Bash, Terminal, and other shells are** in **Day 1**. This will give a solid understanding of the different command-line environments, their purposes, and how they relate to each other. Here's an expanded version of **Day 1**, which introduces students to Bash and other shells like Zsh, PowerShell, etc.

## **let's chat**

### **1. What is the Command Line/Terminal?**

- **The Terminal**: A text-based interface where users can interact with their computer by typing commands instead of using graphical interfaces. It's an environment that allows you to perform tasks like file management, running programs, and system administration efficiently.

  **Key Points**:

  - It's an interface for communicating with the operating system.
  - Commonly referred to as **CLI (Command Line Interface)**.
  - It's faster and more powerful than GUIs (Graphical User Interfaces) for many tasks.

  **Examples of Terminal Applications**:

  - **Linux/Unix/macOS**: Built-in terminal (`gnome-terminal`, `konsole`, etc.).
  - **Windows**: `Command Prompt` or `PowerShell`.

---

### **2. What is Bash?**

- **Bash**: Stands for **"Bourne Again SHell"**, a popular command-line interpreter in Linux and macOS. [Bash in 100 Seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4EWvMFj37g)

  **Key Features**:

  - Allows you to run commands, scripts, and programs.
  - Handles environment variables, I/O redirection, and pipes.
  - Used to automate tasks through shell scripting.

  **Why is Bash important?**:

  - It's the default shell for many Linux distributions.
  - Bash scripts are used for automating tasks, server management, system configurations, and more.

  **Example Bash Command**:

  ```bash
  echo "Hello, World!"
  ```

---

### **3. What is a Shell?**

- **Shell**: The shell is a program that takes commands from the user and gives them to the operating system to execute. Bash is one type of shell, but there are many others.

  **Key Shells**:

  - **Bash**: Default for most Linux systems, very powerful.
  - **Zsh**: A more advanced shell, offers better features and is more customizable than Bash.
  - **Fish**: Friendly Interactive Shell, with a user-friendly syntax and autocompletion.
  - **Korn Shell (ksh)**: An older, robust shell used in Unix systems.
  - **PowerShell**: A command-line shell developed by Microsoft, integrated with Windows for task automation and management.

  **Task**: Run the `bash --version` command in the terminal to check the version of Bash installed on your system.

---

### **4. What is Zsh?**

- **Zsh**: Short for **Z Shell**, it's an enhanced shell with more features than Bash. It includes:

  - Better autocompletion.
  - Customizable themes and plugins (via `Oh My Zsh`).
  - More powerful globbing and shorthand for commands.

  **Why use Zsh?**:

  - Developers and power users often switch to Zsh for more customization and features.

  **Example Task**: Install **Oh My Zsh**, a framework for managing Zsh configurations and themes, and switch your default shell to Zsh:

  ```bash
  sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
  ```

---

### **5. What is PowerShell?**

- **PowerShell**: A powerful shell developed by Microsoft for task automation and configuration management.

  **Key Features**:

  - Available on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
  - Works with **cmdlets**, which are commands built on .NET objects.
  - More geared toward scripting for system administration and management.

  **Why use PowerShell?**:

  - It has robust support for administrative tasks in Windows.
  - It is object-oriented and can handle data as objects, which is useful in complex scripting.

  **Example PowerShell Command**:

  ```powershell
  Get-Process
  ```

---

### **6. Shell vs. Terminal**

- **Terminal**: The actual program you use to access your shell (e.g., the terminal window in your OS).
- **Shell**: The program inside the terminal that interprets commands (Bash, Zsh, Fish, PowerShell, etc.).

  **Example**:

  - When you open a terminal window in Linux, you're using a **terminal emulator** (like GNOME Terminal or Konsole).
  - Inside that terminal emulator, you're likely interacting with the **Bash shell** or another shell.

  **Task**: Open your terminal and type `echo $SHELL` to find out which shell you are using.

---

### **7. Common Shell Commands Across All Shells**

Here are some basic commands that work in **Bash**, **Zsh**, and other POSIX-compliant shells:

- **`ls`**: List files and directories in the current directory.
- **`cd`**: Change directory.
- **`pwd`**: Print working directory (shows the current directory path).
- **`mkdir`**: Make a new directory.
- **`rm`**: Remove a file or directory.
- **`mv`**: Move or rename a file or directory.
- **`cp`**: Copy files and directories.
- **`echo`**: Print text to the terminal.
